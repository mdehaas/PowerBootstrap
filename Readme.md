PowerShell Bootstrap
====================

Small bootstrap script which allows you to run scripts which are 
contained in XML files and reside on a web server.

This script was created to allow scripts to run in our entire 
environment, also on servers running in a DMZ.

Development was dropped in favour of Desired State Configuration
so I decides to make it available to the world.
